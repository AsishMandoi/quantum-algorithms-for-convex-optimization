    "This thesis asks the following central question\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "*Can quantum computers solve convex optimization problems faster?*\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to answer this question we consider a few different types of problem that we may encounter in convex optimization. If we have some black-box procedure to evaluate how good a proposed solution to a convex optimization problem is, for example a way of estimating the height of apoint in the Alps or a method of estimating our profits given a business strategy, then a classical computer would have to try a lot of small changes in order to find the change that improves our objective the most. However, we show that a quantum computer can find the optimal direction for improvement **exponentially faster**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then consider specific categories of convex optimization problems, mainly linear programming and semidefinite programming. These problem categories include many natural problems and have been widely used both for theoretical and practical purposes. For example, **linear programming** can be used for finding the optimal strategies of zero-sum games, coming up with a diet plan, or planning resources. **Semidefinite programming** is a generalization of linear programming and can additionally be useful for designing optimal experiments, approximately solving hard problems, or optimize processes involving quantum mechanics. Our quantum algorithms for these problems use a natural connection between quantum physics and semidefinite programming: the solutions to a semidefinite programming problem correspond to the states of a quantum system. **We show that quantum computers can solve semidefinite programming problems and linear programming problems quadratically faster than a classical computer can**. In fact, our algorithms take less time to solve the problem than that it would take to read through the whole input."
